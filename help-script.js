        question: 'How do I log birds I\'ve seen during my trip?',
        answer: 'Open your active trip from the Trip Logs screen, find the bird in your itinerary, and tap the checkbox next to it to mark it as seen. You can also add notes and the number of birds spotted. These sightings will automatically be added to your Life List. Additionally, you can use the "Add Sighting" floating button in the Trip Logs screen to quickly log birds you see outside of planned trips.',

        question: 'How accurate is the AI bird identification?',
        answer: 'AI bird identification is experimental and should always be validated. Sound detection uses the Cornell BirdNET model with enhanced sensitivity (3-5% confidence threshold) and optional regional species filtering to improve accuracy for local birds. Photo identification analyzes visual features to suggest species. Accuracy depends on factors like audio quality, background noise, image clarity, lighting conditions, and bird visibility. Confidence scores help indicate the model\'s certainty, but even high-confidence results should be verified with field guides or expert birders. The regional filtering feature can significantly improve accuracy by boosting confidence for species commonly found in your area. Note: The bird database supporting AI features is currently incomplete, so some species may not be recognized or may have limited information. Use AI as a helpful starting point, not a definitive identification.',

        question: 'How do I use the real-time bird sound detection?',
        answer: 'Go to ID > Bird Sounds Detection and tap START to begin listening. Grant microphone permissions when prompted. The app uses advanced BirdNET AI with enhanced sensitivity settings (Low/Medium/High) and regional species filtering for improved accuracy. Choose your sensitivity level - High detects more birds but may include false positives, while Low is more conservative. Enable "Regional Species Filter" to boost confidence for birds common in your area. **Smart Detection Features:** When a bird is detected for the FIRST time in your session, a detailed bird information card automatically opens showing habitat, identification features, and photos. For subsequent detections of the same species, the existing entry in your list highlights briefly with a "ðŸ”Š Detected again!" message. **Intelligent Filtering:** The app automatically filters out non-bird sounds like human voices, traffic, machinery, and other animals, focusing only on actual bird detections. **Enhanced Processing:** Enable Enhanced Processing for advanced audio quality assessment, noise reduction, and ensemble detection with consensus scoring for improved accuracy. Detected birds are added to a new trip log session. When you finish and birds were detected, you can add them to existing active trips or create a new standalone trip log.',

        question: 'How do I use AI bird photo identification?',
        answer: 'Go to ID > Bird Photo Detection to identify birds from your photos. You can select multiple photos from your gallery or take new ones with the camera. The AI analyzes each image and provides species suggestions with confidence scores. For best results, use clear, well-lit photos showing the bird prominently. You can view results grouped by species or individually by photo. When you tap "Create New Trip", the app intelligently checks for existing active trips. If you have active trips, you\'ll be offered the option to add detected birds to an existing trip location through a location picker, or create a new trip. This preserves all your existing planned locations while adding the new sightings. Remember that AI identification is experimental and should be verified with field guides.',

        answer: 'Tap the Plan tab, then use the location picker to set your search area. Choose your search radius (1-50 miles) and select dates for your trip. You can either let the app auto-plan optimal locations or manually select specific birds you want to see. The system will analyze recent eBird data to suggest the best hotspots and create an optimized route. Review the suggestions, make any adjustments, and save your trip to get started.',

        question: 'What is the difference between auto-planning and manual planning?',
        answer: 'Auto-planning automatically selects optimal birding locations based on recent eBird data, bird rarity, and accessibility. It\'s great for discovering new spots and maximizing your chances of seeing diverse species. Manual planning lets you choose specific birds you want to target, giving you more control over your trip content. You can combine both approaches - start with auto-planning and then customize by adding or removing specific birds or locations.',

        question: 'How does the route optimization work?',
        answer: 'The route optimization considers several factors: distance between locations, bird likelihood based on recent sightings, accessibility of hotspots, and your time constraints. By default, routes optimize from your search location, but you can enable "Start route from current location" to begin from wherever you are. The system also offers filtering options like "Exclude seen birds" and "Exclude visited hotspots" to focus on new experiences.',

        question: 'What are the colored markers on the map?',
        answer: 'Map markers are color-coded to indicate bird diversity and observation frequency. Bright red markers show areas with the highest species counts, while yellow markers indicate lower diversity. Marker size also indicates observation frequency - larger markers mean more frequent sightings. Stars indicate official eBird hotspots, while circles show casual or user-reported locations.',

        answer: 'Confidence scores indicate the AI\'s certainty about a bird identification, shown as percentages. Higher scores (80%+) suggest more confident identifications, while lower scores (20-50%) indicate less certainty. Even high-confidence results should be verified with field guides or expert knowledge. Regional filtering can boost confidence for local species, improving overall accuracy.',
