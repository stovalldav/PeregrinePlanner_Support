            <h2>AI Model Usage and Data Training</h2>
            <p>Peregrine Planner incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) models to enhance bird identification and user experience. Please be aware of the following regarding AI usage:</p>
            
            <h3>AI Bird Identification Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sound Detection</strong>: We use Cornell's BirdNET AI model for real-time bird sound identification. This model analyzes audio data locally on your device to identify bird species from their sounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Identification</strong>: Our AI analyzes images you provide to suggest bird species based on visual features. This processing occurs locally on your device or on our secure servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Processing</strong>: Optional enhanced processing features may use additional AI models for improved accuracy, including noise reduction and consensus scoring.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Data Training and Privacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Training Data Usage</strong>: Your personal bird identification data, photos, audio recordings, and other user-generated content are NEVER used to train AI models or shared with AI model developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing</strong>: Bird identification processing occurs locally on your device whenever possible, meaning your data doesn't leave your device for AI analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Processing</strong>: When server-side processing is required, your data is processed securely and deleted immediately after analysis - it is never stored or used for model training.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party AI Models</strong>: We use established AI models (such as BirdNET) that have been trained on publicly available datasets. We do not contribute your personal data to these training datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Experimental Features</strong>: AI identification features are experimental and should always be validated against field guides or expert birders. Results are provided as suggestions, not definitive identifications.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>AI Model Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AI identification accuracy depends on various factors including audio quality, image clarity, lighting conditions, and environmental factors</li>
                <li>The bird database supporting AI features may be incomplete, and some species may not be recognized</li>
                <li>Confidence scores indicate the model's certainty but should not be considered absolute measures of accuracy</li>
                <li>Regional filtering features may improve accuracy for local species but may miss rare or out-of-range birds</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>eBird Data Usage</h2>
            <p>Peregrine Planner uses bird observation data from eBird, which is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Please be aware that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bird sighting data provided in the App comes from eBird's database of observations</li>
                <li>The App accesses recent eBird data to show birds that have been reported near your location</li>
                <li>eBird is among the world's largest biodiversity-related science projects, with millions of bird sightings contributed by birders globally. eBird is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and collects data documenting bird distribution, abundance, habitat use, and trends through checklist data collected within a scientific framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>eBird Data Terms and Privacy</h3>
            <p>When using eBird data through our App or contributing your sightings to eBird:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All eBird data are provided for non-commercial use in research and education. Thousands of participants freely provide data to eBird, and in this same spirit, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology makes these data freely available.</li>
                <li>The Cornell Lab will never use or share your personal information for commercial purposes. Your contact information is only available to the team at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and volunteer regional reviewers.</li>
                <li>When you export sightings to eBird, you contribute to a global citizen science project that helps track bird populations, migration patterns, and habitat needs.</li>
                <li>Raw data, including latitude and longitude of observation locations, are freely shared with researchers upon request. eBird checklists will display name and location data, though name display can be turned off by the user.</li>
            </ul>
